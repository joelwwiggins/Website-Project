# Plotly Belly Button Diversity
In this assignment, I build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Dashboard Breakdown
My dashboard includes the following:
* dropdown menu of all the study participants
* table that populates with participant info
* top 10 microbial species
* bubble chart of microbial species
